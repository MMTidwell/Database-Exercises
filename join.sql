-- Use join, left join, and right join to combine results from the users and roles tables as we did in the lesson. Before you run each query, guess the expected number of results.
-- join
/* SELECT users.name AS user_name, roles.name AS role_name
FROM users
JOIN roles ON users.role_id = roles.id; */
SELECT * 
FROM users AS u
JOIN roles AS r
	ON r.id = u.rol_id;
-- left join
/* SELECT users.name AS user_name, roles.name AS role_name
FROM users
LEFT JOIN roles ON users.role_id = roles.id; */
SELECT *
FROM users AS u
LEFT JOIN roles AS r
	ON r.id = u.role_id;
-- right join
/* SELECT users.name AS user_name, roles.name AS role_name
FROM users
RIGHT JOIN roles ON users.role_id = roles.id; */
SELECT *
FROM users AS u
RIGHT JOIN roles AS r
	ON r.id = u.role_id;

-- Although NOT explicitly covered IN the lesson, AGGREGATE functions LIKE count can be used WITH JOIN queries. USE count AND the appropriate JOIN TYPE TO get a LIST of roles along WITH the number of users that has the role. Hint: You will also need TO USE GROUP BY IN the query.
-- prints the columns being pulled and titles the column
SELECT r.name, count(u.name) AS num_of_users
-- users are unique, roles are not unique engouh 
FROM users AS u
-- right join so we can see all of the roles enven if they are null, if we just do join then we will not see the null values, if we do left join we will see null for commenter 
RIGHT JOIN roles AS r
	ON u.role_id = r.id
GROUP BY r.name;
